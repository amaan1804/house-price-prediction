# house-price-prediction

In this project, we will perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset and built a 
linear regression model to predict house prices.

We will process the data, explore correlations and relationships using visualizations, 
select relevant features based on EDA insights, built and trained a linear regression model, and evaluated its performance.
